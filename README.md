# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The following data analysis was done to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early of May 2019 and create a compelling visualization for a leading CEO. This visualization could help the company, PyBer, improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighbourhoods. Finally, the project was tasked with the opportunity to submit a written report that summarized how data differed by city type and how the differences could be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

The PyBer Analysis clearly displayed the massive gap in disparities between the urban, suburban and rural cities in terms of driver count, fare collected and number of rides.

The summary dataframe below explains a lot as to why the massive differences are seen followed by a detailed explanation:

Key observations from the above dataframe are:

 * There is a huge demand for PyBer services in the rural areas. This can be seen by the high number of average fare per ride of $34.62 compared to the urban which has a lower fee of $24.53. This is further shown by the average fare per driver by city type in rural areas at $55.49 compared to urban areas which is at $16.57 which is more than thrice as much. Inasmuch as there is a low number of drivers in the rural areas which is directly proportional to the total fares and rides, its inverse proportionality in terms of average fares shows a huge demand. The high number of rides in urban areas is expected since urban areas have a lot of activity as shown by the pie chart below:

*  With huge demand, there was less earnings in weekly fares from rural areas. The image below shows the massive difference in earnings in a weekly basis which can be interpreted as follows; the seemingly high average fare per driver is putting off customers in rural areas and the low average fare per driver in urban areas is attracting customers.

## Recommendations

After conclusive analysis of the PyBer data, the following are helpful recommendations to help in equality and distribution of services: 

 1. Increasing number of drivers in rural areas. This could help lower the average fare per driver which could be a reason behind the low number of rides and (weekly)earnings from such areas. This can be done by introducing incentives for drivers who sign up from rural areas. This will be vital in helping the underserved neighbourhoods have access to PyBer services and hence encourage equality and no massive gaps in  terms of average fare per driver. 

 2. Find ways to help reduce the high number of drivers in urban areas to even out the average fare per driver with suburban and rural areas. This is because sometimes the supply can outweigh the demand and hence a bad look for the business as drivers are underpaid due to low fare charged. 

 3. Since urban areas' drivers are greatly underpaid compared to suburban and rural areas' drivers - seen by the negative difference in average fare between per ride and per driver of around -$8 which can be discouraging as compared to a positive difference of $9 to $21 for drivers in suburban and rural areas respectively- there is the risk of losing many drivers from urban areas as they may be unmotivated by the low earnings and at the moment they have the highest earnings.
